# Audio Programming Coursework
## CW1b Playing multipart audio with slider control of synthesis parameters

A documented well structured chuck programme which reads files into arrays to load a timed sequence for each musical part and plays these back while sound can be adjusted using HTML sliders (40%)

Although this sounds complicated, the coursework is to be developed by modifying example code.  A deal of library code is provided to support the process and a bridge application is provided to link the sliders to chuck.  The code for this piece will be split up into a number of small files which work together.

 The second portfolio files should be in a folder named B00xxxxxx_CWb.  This will be based on the second section of module notes (or revision notes).  
 
 Documentation to accompany this should consist of a listing of the code (excluding any library routines) and a discussion of how the code operates illustrated by sections of line numbered, syntax highlighted code.  

 The synthesis section should make an interesting sound based on synthesis techniques such as additive synthesis, modulation, detuning or available UGENS.  The synthesis should be interesting so better to avoid STK instruments.  

The marking criteria will be based on the generation of a source text file, the coding of the application, the synthesis of audio produced and the documentation according to the following guidelines which will be weighted to 40%



The marks will contribute 40% of the module marks.
* Music Format conversion (10%)
* Code for playback and control (10%)
* Sound patch for synthesis (10%)
* Documentation (10%)


### Marking Scheme

The marking scheme has been adapted from the handbook for the purposes of the resit submission as follows:

| Music Format Conversion (10%).  |    Music -> xml -> abc -> mdv |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent:  | As B1 but with a high degree of originality in a more complex musical construction which is correctly interpreted by the software.
| B1  | Very Good:  Two or more parts accurately notated in abc and play back correctly |
| B2    | Good: A single melodic phrase is accurately notated in abc and plays back correctly   |
| C   |  Satisfactory: A single melodic phrase is accurately notated in abc.                 |
| D    |  Weak: An abc File is readable but does not accurately notate the intended musical content.    |

| Code for controlled audio playback of text file (10%).         | Structure and operation of code |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent:  As B1 with well-scaled control parameters making effective musical effect.      |
| B1  | Very Good:  Code allows two parts to be played back with separate control applied to two sounds.   |
| B2    | Good: Code allows single part to be played back with control applied to sound.  |
| C   |  Satisfactory: Code allows single part to be played back.    |
| D    |  Weak: Code does not produce intended audio output or is not developed beyond the template file.                            |



| Synthesis (10%).         |    Use of synthesis techniques to render audio  |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent:  Well organised synthesis reflecting reading outside the module core  |
| B1  | Very Good:  Two synthesised voices both with moderate complexity  |
| B2    | Good: synthesis based on a standard method: additive, subtractive, modulation.           |
| C   |  Satisfactory:  Basic synthesis based on library instrument or simple oscillator.   |
| D    |  Weak: Patch does not produce audio output         |

| Documentation (10%).  |    Mark down description of patch operation |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent: Detailed description of a moderately complex synthesis and control operation which shows good understanding of the code, is illustrated with appropriate code extracts and reflects a degree of originality.        |
| B1  | Very Good: Structured report with syntax highlighted listing of key sections with adequate description of control code and synthesis patch.                  |
| B2    | Good: Structured report with syntax highlighted listing of key sections with adequate description of control code or synthesis patch.               |
| C   |  Satisfactory: Structured report with syntax highlighted listing of key sections with adequate description.                 |
| D    |  Weak: Listing of programme with inadequate formatting or description.                          |


Note that this portfolio piece is 40% of the module marks. You may use example code from the module as a starter to develop from.
