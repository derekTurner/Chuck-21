# Polyphonic sound

A demonstration file collection which allows polyphonic sound to be played from a control keyboard is described here and the essence of the final coursework portfolio CW1c is to edit this to produce your own customised sound set.

This polyphonic instrument will respond to MIDI so you could play if from within a DAW.
