# Audio Programming Coursework
## CW1a Playing sounds and samples in a timed sequence

A documented loosely structured chuck patch which plays a timed sequence of sounds combining simple synthesis and sound file playback, (20%)

 The first portfolio files should be in a folder named B00xxxxxx_CWa.  This will be based on the first section of module notes (or revision notes).  
 
 You are asked to create a track which features a timed series of sounds produced from oscillators and sample playback. 
 
 The track does not need to play a melody, but it must reflect a musical structure and should run for at least 24 seconds.   
 
 You should describe your code in a markdown file to be included in this folder.

The marks will contribute 20% of the module marks.
* Time based audio generated by synthesis (5%)
* Time based audio generated by samples (5%)
* Documentation (10%)


### Marking Scheme

The marking scheme has been adapted from the handbook for the purposes of the resit submission as follows:

| Time sequence (5%).  |    Code and musical structure |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent: A musically structured sequence is played of suitable duration integrating synthesis and sampled audio as a coherent piece with good code layout and utilization of code features such as conditional statements, loops and randomization. |
| B1  | Very Good: A musically structured sequence is played of suitable duration integrating synthesis and sampled audio as a coherent piece with good code layout.   |
| B2    | Good: A musically structured sequence is played of suitable duration using synthesis and sampled audio in separate sections.        |
| C   |  Satisfactory: A musically structured sequence is played of suitable duration using synthesis or sampled audio.          |
| D    |  Weak: Code contains errors which prevent it from running         |

| Synthesis (5%).  | Detail of sound patch |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent:  A moderately complex patch which has an evolving sound and reflects background reading.     |
| B1  | Very Good: A moderately complex patch.      |
| B2    | Good: A simple patch which does not produce clicking.          |
| C   |  Satisfactory: A simple patch for example combining oscillators.          |
| D    |  Weak: Simple sinewave oscillator             |



| Time based samples (5%).   |    Code structure to play back samples and playback parameters   |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent: Multiple samples are generated and processed before use.    |
| B1  | Very Good: A sample is generated and processed before use with pitch shifting        |
| B2    | Good: A sample is sourced and processed before use with pitch shifting     |
| C   |  Satisfactory: A sample provided in the module content is correctly utilized.         |
| D    |  Weak: Some samples are sounded, but do not play back as intended                            |

| Documentation (5%).  |    Mark down description of patch operation |
| -- |----- |
| A3 Excellent, A2 Outstanding, A1 Exceptional |Excellent: Structured report with syntax highlighted listing of key sections with adequate description of timing code and synthesis patch and discussion of sample production reflects a degree of originality.         |
| B1  | Very Good: Structured report with syntax highlighted listing of key sections with adequate description of timing code and synthesis patch and discussion of sample production.                   |
| B2    | Good: Structured report with syntax highlighted listing of key sections with adequate description of timing code and synthesis patch.               |
| C   |  Satisfactory: Structured report with syntax highlighted listing of key sections with adequate description.                 |
| D    |  Weak: Listing of programme with inadequate formatting or description.                          |


Note that this portfolio piece is only 20% of the module marks and should only use techiques discussed in the notes up to around week 4.  You are not expected to use functions or arrays in your timebased code.  You may use example code from the module as a starter to develop from.
